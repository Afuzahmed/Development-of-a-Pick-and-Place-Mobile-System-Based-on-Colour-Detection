# Development-of-a-Pick-and-Place-Mobile-System-Based-on-Colour-Detection

The project titled “ Development of a Pick and Place Mobile System Based on Colour
Detection” is carried out to operate a mobile robot as per the given colour detecting instructions. This project is a small example of automation technology. The application of
such technology is already in the rise and the current pandemic has given it a tremendous
boost.
By the help of the design proposed in this project, we aim to achieve a semi-automatic
action of picking and placing objects at a desirable place reducing the manual engagement.
Such a system can be very useful in performing tasks that require safety and precaution
and also hygiene maintenance. The robot will travel to the required location and perform
the mentioned operation after detecting the colour of the object.

In this project, I have used pysthon as the main programming language. Different libaraies are used to different opeartion.

Libaray used 

1) Numpy 
2) opencv
3) math
4) tkinter
5) pyserial
6) PyCMDmessenger
7) requests
8) imutils

For the hardware programming, Using pyCMDmessenger I have establish the interaction between arduino and python.

Before running mail file, make sure your arduino boards are connected to the right ports. One can change the ports name in ard.py and Ard_pycmd.py file.

HARDWARE REQUIRMENTS:

1) Arduino Uno

2) Arduino Mega

3) CNC shield 

3) Two DC motor

4) L298N DC motor driver

5) Three NEMA17 stepper motor

6) Three stepper motor drivers(Model: DRV8825)

7) 12V adapter

8) Vacuum pump

9) Relay
